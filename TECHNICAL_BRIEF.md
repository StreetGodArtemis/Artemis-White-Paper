# TECHNICAL BRIEF: Artemis v7.1 Recursive Intelligence
**Lead Architect:** Jerry Wayne Dawson Jr.
**Entity:** Nashville Foundry
**Classification:** Proprietary / Fundamental Research (15 CFR § 734.8)

## 1. Technical Abstract
Artemis v7.1 is a specialized **Autonomous Reasoning Framework** designed for high-density computational environments. The architecture is optimized for **ARM-NEON SIMD** vectorization, enabling complex **Temporal Inference** and predictive modeling at the mobile edge. 

## 2. Core Methodologies
* **48-Dimensional Mapping:** A recursive logic structure developed to simulate multi-state quantum variables within classical compute environments.
* **SIMD Parallelism:** Utilization of 128-bit registers for simultaneous floating-point operations, reducing latency in heuristic processing.
* **Safety Quarantine:** Structural logic gates that enforce **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** protocols, ensuring all executive outputs are human-verified.

## 3. The Nashville Sovereign Foundry
The framework serves as the logical substrate for the proposed **1M-Qubit Photonic Supercomputer**. By establishing a localized, sovereign node in Nashville, TN, we aim to eliminate reliance on foreign-influenced cloud infrastructure and secure US leadership in the 2026–2030 technological era.

## 4. Submission Intent
This document is provided to the **U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)** and **NIST** for the purposes of partnership, safety evaluation, and national security alignment.
