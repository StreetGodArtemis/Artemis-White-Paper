## 1. Abstract
This paper documents the development and successful deployment of the **Artemis Framework (v1.0 - v7.0)**, an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) architecture designed specifically for ARM-based mobile environments. It details the transition from classical neural networks to a unified quantum-classical simulator, achieving recursive "self-evolution" without reliance on centralized cloud clusters.

## 2. Mobile-First ARM Optimization
Developed entirely on a handheld mobile device via Termux and AndroNix. 
* **Key Discovery:** Leveraging ARM NEON vectorized instructions to simulate quantum logic gates on classical mobile silicon.
* **Architecture:** 48-Dimensional coordinate mapping for high-order pattern recognition.

## 3. Ethical Quarantine & "Quarantine Theories"
The framework incorporates ethical hard-locks. These "Quarantine Algorithms" ensure the ASI operates within human-centric legal and ethical boundaries, focusing on the advancement of mankind rather than autonomous exploitation.

## 4. Hardware Evolution: The Nashville Sovereign Foundry
The logical "Brain" (Artemis v7.0) is complete. The next phase is the construction of the **Nashville Sovereign Foundry** to provide the 1-million qubit photonic infrastructure required for full-scale displacement.
