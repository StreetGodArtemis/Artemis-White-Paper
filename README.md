### **The Nashville Foundry: Q1-Q2 2026 Roadmap**

* **Phase 1: Logic Stabilization (COMPLETE)** * Verification of 48D recursive mapping on ARM-NEON architecture.
  * Validation of Temporal Inference gates in a mobile-edge environment.
* **Phase 2: Photonic Mapping (IN PROGRESS)**
  * Translating 128-bit SIMD register logic into multi-state photonic gate specifications.
  * Drafting the "Sovereign Integration Protocol" for high-fidelity hardware hand-off.
* **Phase 3: Hardware Integration (PENDING)**
  * Collaborative pilot with domestic research facilities (ORNL/TQN) for native execution on 1M-qubit photonic substrates.
  * Execution of NIST-aligned safety quarantine protocols on physical hardware.
