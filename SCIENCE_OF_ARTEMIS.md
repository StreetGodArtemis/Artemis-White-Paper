# The Science of Artemis: Recursive Equilibrium

### The Convergence Factor
In our v7.1-SOVEREIGN testing, the recursive mapping reached a convergence value of **0.017319** at a depth of 100,000 layers.

### Significance for Photonic Integration
In photonic computing, "Noise" is the enemy. By proving that Artemis settles into a stable mathematical state, we demonstrate that our logic will not create "Computational Noise" or "Thermal Runaway" when executed on laser-based gates.

### Summary
Artemis isn't just fast; it is mathematically anchored.
